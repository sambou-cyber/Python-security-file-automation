# Python Security Algorithm - File Update Automation

## Overview
This project demonstrates a Python-based algorithm used to manage and update an IP allow list for restricted system access. The scenario simulates a real-world security task where IP addresses must be reviewed and removed based on updated access requirements.

The solution focuses on secure file handling, data parsing, access control logic, and automation using reusable Python functions.

---

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Secure file handling using `with` and `open()`
- Reading and writing files with `.read()` and `.write()`
- Converting strings to lists using `.split()`
- Iteration and conditional logic for access control
- Removing unauthorized IP addresses using `.remove()`
- Automating workflows with reusable functions
- Regular expressions for IP address extraction
